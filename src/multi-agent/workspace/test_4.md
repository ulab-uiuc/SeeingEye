Question: For your independent research, you transferred lymphocyte populations between syngeneic mice. You irradiated recipients first to ablate (get rid of) existing lymphocytes, then transferred defined cell populations from donors of same genetic background. The result is shown in <image 1>. What does this experiment tell us?
Options: ['Both B cells and T cells can produce antibodies.', 'Both B cells and T cells have memory functions.', 'Both B cells and T cells are required for an antibody response.', 'B cells are required for an antibody response in the absence of T cells.', 'B cells and T cells are co-localized and produce synergetic effects in bone marrow and thymus.']
